    "with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams. \n",

    "the open() function does what the name implies – it opens a file for you so you can work with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the open function, you declare a variable for it first. The open() function takes up to 3 parameters – the filename, the mode, and the encoding. You can then specify what you want to do with the file in a print function.\n",
