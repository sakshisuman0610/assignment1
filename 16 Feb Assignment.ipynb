    "Language – \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases defines and manipulates data based structured query language (SQL). Seeing from a side this language is extremely powerful. SQL is one \n",
    "\n",
    "of the most versatile and widely-used options available which makes it a safe choice especially for great complex queries. But from other side it can \n",
    "\n",
    "be restrictive. SQL requires you to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Also all of your data must \n",
    "\n",
    "follow the same structure. This can require significant up-front preparation which means that a change in the structure would be both difficult and \n",
    "\n",
    "disruptive to your whole system. \n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database has dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, \n",
    "\n",
    "graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having defined structure first. Also each \n",
    "\n",
    "document can have its own unique structure. The syntax varies from database to database, and you can add fields as you go. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability – \n",
    "\n",
    "In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like \n",
    "\n",
    "RAM, CPU or SSD. But on the other hand NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more \n",
    "\n",
    "servers in your NoSQL database. It is similar to adding more floors to the same building versus adding more buildings to the neighborhood. Thus NoSQL \n",
    "\n",
    "can ultimately become larger and more powerful, making these databases the preferred choice for large or ever-changing data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure – \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are table-based on the other hand NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide-column stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes relational SQL databases a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions such as an accounting system or for legacy \n",
    "\n",
    "systems that were built for a relational structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Property followed – \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem \n",
    "\n",
    "(Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance). \n",
    "\n",
    "Support – \n",
    "\n",
    "Great support is available for all SQL database from their vendors. Also a lot of independent consultations are there who can help you with SQL \n",

    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. Tables and formulas are helpful when communicating with data stored up to a point in a database through SQL, but a time comes when we actually want to execute some fairly complicated data interactions. We will also need the Data Manipulation Language in that situation. DML is a way to inform a database precisely what we want it to do by conversing in a manner that it has been built to comprehend from the scratch. When it comes to interacting within existing data, whether adding, moving, or deleting data, it provides a convenient way to do so.\n",

    "The Database Management System offers a framework of functions or dialects to modify or alter the data, called the Data Manipulation Language. Data manipulation could be done perhaps by typing SQL queries or by using, a typically called Query-by-Example (QBE) graphical interface. These declarations are used to modify the data found in the tables. These declarations are going to work on results. There is no relation with the structure of the tables for these statements. Data manipulation includes introducing data into tables, altering the table’s data and deleting the data from the table.\n",
